**⚠ Looking for maintenance help/adoption! ⚠**

I have my hands way too full with regular OctoPrint maintenance, so any help with maintaining this plugin or even outright adoption would be greatly appreciated!

# OctoPrint-Autoselect

The Autoselect Plugin will automatically select newly uploaded files for
printing if there is an active connection to a printer and currently no print
job running.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:
